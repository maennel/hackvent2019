# Introduction

This is the second time I participated in a [Hackvent](https://hackvent.hacking-lab.com). After last year, I tried to solve all challenges during this year's 2019 edition. And I succeeded. 

However, I would not have managed to complete all challenges in time without the help I've received. To start, I want to thank my soon-to-be wife for being so patient with me. As others have pointed out, Hackvent can be a pretty intense time for a relationship.

Furthermore, I want to thank *mcia* who is always incredibly patient and always reaches out with a helping hand when I ask my n00b questions. Others who have given hints or helped in another way are *bread*, *0xCC*, *LogicalOverflow*, *each*, *DrSchottky*, *Wulgaru*, and *M.*. Thank you all, you've helped me learning and discovering new things, which is incredibly valuable and appreciated.

Of course, I want to thank all the organizers and challenge creators. You've invested sweat, blood and probably tears to make this happen.

Hereafter, you'll find a write-up of all challenges in Hackvent 2019 (taking place during December 2019) annotated with solution approaches, notes and comments by myself. 

Have fun.

Yours,
