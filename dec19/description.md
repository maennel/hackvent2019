## Approach
Emojis, yay! Well, with Hackvent you get used to search for things by appending "vulnerability" or "lang". So it was in this case. Not loong after starting the work, I stumbled on https://www.emojicode.org/ (not to be confused with Mozilla's https://codemoji.org/).

On that page, one can learn about programming with emojis. Which, to be honest, is not reeeaally something that you'd use in your everyday's work. 

After compiling the above program withe the provided codec, an executable was generated. It printed a couple of emojis and expected an input: 

 🔒 ➡️ 🎅🏻⁉️ ➡️ 🎄🚩

Which can probably be read as "things are locked, then Santa does something, then there's Christmas and a flag.".

If a wrong input was supplied, a 🤯 was displayed.

After some "source code" reversing and with a bit of luck, I found out, that there was only one character expected. 

With some guessing (which could probably be done through brute forcing), I found out a 🔑 was expected, which then printed the flag.
